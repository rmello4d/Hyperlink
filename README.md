##Hyperlink widget for Wakanda##

The __Hyperlink__ widget allows you to create a &lt;a&gt; tag  whose source and text can both be datasources. You can use it to create live hyperlinks on your Page that are either email addresses or URLs.


### Utilisation
Once you have installed the Hyperlink widget in Wakanda, you can copy it to your Page.

You can either drag a datasource of type Attribute on top of the widget to define the two datasources or select the attribute in the two properties:

* __Hyperlink source__: Either an email address or a URL
* __Hyperlink text__: The text that appears in the &lt;a&gt;...&lt;/a&gt; tag, which is visible on the browser.

The other properties you can define are:

* __Target__: You can select either "_blank" to force the browser to open a new page/tab or "_self" to allow the browser to replace the existing page.
* __Default text__: If you do not want to bind a datasource of type Attribute to Hyperlink text, the value in this property will be displayed each time  in the &lt;a&gt;...&lt;/a&gt; tag.
* __Label__: A label that you can add to the widget.
